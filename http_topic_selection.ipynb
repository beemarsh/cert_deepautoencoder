    "- **Avoids Artificial Ordinality:** Unlike Label Encoding, Binary Encoding doesn't introduce an arbitrary numerical order among categories, preventing the model from misinterpreting relationships.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Efficiency:** Binary Encoding transforms categories into a compact binary format, significantly reducing the number of features compared to One-Hot Encoding while preserving uniqueness.\n",

    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Avoids artificial ordinality.\n",
    "- More compact than One-Hot Encoding (~10 columns for 1,000 categories).\n",
    "- Preserves uniqueness of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Slightly more complex implementation.\n",
    "- Binary features are less interpretable individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Encoding** offers a balanced approach for high-cardinality categorical features by maintaining uniqueness without inflating dimensionality or introducing artificial order, making it a superior choice over **Label Encoding** for scenarios like representing 1,000 unique users."
